  * Checking for duplicates;
  * Filtering unwanted outliers.
* Day 3 - Transforming the data:
  * Scaling numerical features;
  * Encoding categorical features.
* Day 4 - Modelling:
  * Creating a model;
  * Testing the model;
  * Comparing predicted and test results;
  * Plotting test results.
* Day 5 - Presentation:
  * Presenting the model.
